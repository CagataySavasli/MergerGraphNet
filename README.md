# MergerGraphNet

### A Graph Neural Network Approach for Predicting Corporate Mergers from 10-K MD&A Text

**MergerGraphNet** is an AI-driven framework that combines **TF-IDF embeddings**, **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to predict corporate mergers using **10-K Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections**.

This project is designed as a **binary classification task**, predicting whether a company will **merge** or **not merge** based on financial disclosures.

## 🚀 Features

- **📊 Graph-Based Representation:** Constructs company-entity relationships from financial reports.
- **📝 TF-IDF Embeddings:** Converts textual disclosures into structured numerical representations.
- **🧠 GNN-Powered Predictions:** Classifies companies as Merge or Not-Merge using graph-based learning.
- **⚡ Scalable & Efficient:** Handles large-scale financial text corpora.

## 🛠 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CagataySavasli/MergerGraphNet.git
cd MergerGraphNet
```

## 📌 Research Context

MergerGraphNet aims to **bridge financial text mining with graph-based learning**, providing a novel AI-driven approach to **predict corporate mergers** from **structured financial disclosures**.
