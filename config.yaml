project:
  name: "MergerGraphNet"
  description: "MergerGraphNet utilizes TF-IDF embeddings and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict corporate mergers from 10-K MD&A text. It builds financial knowledge graphs, extracts key insights using TF-IDF-based embeddings, and identifies acquisition targets. Scalable and efficient, it bridges financial text mining with graph-based learning."
